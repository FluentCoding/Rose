description: Prevents launching main.py due to UAC requirements

# Main.py Launch Restriction

**NEVER attempt to launch [main.py](mdc:main.py) from the Cursor shell or any development environment.**

The main.py file requires UAC (User Account Control) elevation to run properly, which cannot be provided in the Cursor shell environment. Attempting to run it will result in permission errors or failure.

Instead of launching main.py, just ask the user to test the new changes itself and give its feedback.
